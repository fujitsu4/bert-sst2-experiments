**Experiment Design Strategy**

In the first experiment (Trained BERT), the code was deliberately designed to process one layer at a time. This design choice was made to facilitate faster testing, ensure reproducibility, and allow for layer-by-layer analysis. The third experiment (No punctuation) follows the same principle.

**Handling Randomness in Untrained Models**

In contrast, the second experiment (Untrained BERT) involved a randomly initialized (untrained) model. Since the weights were randomly generated, results varied with each runâ€”even when using the same random seed. Therefore, it was not feasible to isolate the analysis by layer. For this reason, the second experiment uses a global script that processes all layers and all iterations in a unified manner.
